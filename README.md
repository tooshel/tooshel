### Hi there 👋 2025! Here is what I'm up to!

- 🔭 I’m currently looking for a job! Seeking Engineering Management/Embedded Systems Roles. Previously Head of Engineering Management at Satellite.im. 
- 🌱 I have been working on a new tool for running [JavaScript games](https://github.com/monteslu/jsgamelauncher) on inexpensive Ambernic devices. I made a few of my own games including the "[Slide Game](https://github.com/tooshel/slidegame)" that was used at HalfStack. The game was installed on a $50 gaming device and it [ran the slides](https://youtu.be/uCdcmxwFoWg). 
- 🛠️ I am really into 3D Printing and have my own little garden of 3D Printers. I have several Prusa printers as well as a Bambu and a few others. I love putting them together! Not a fan of how Bambu does things but the printer and the AMS is really well done. Open Source for life! We can't let 3D printing turn into what 2D printing is. I have a Voron 0.2 that works great as well as a Positron that I'm still working on. 
- 👯 I’m collaborating on a SasS product! I've been working in the "PropTech" industry for many years and some old colleagues reached out. We continue to make progress on our little SaaS product that's comming soon! This is my chance to get more into product development, marketing, etc and fill in more of the parts of running a business that I'm excited to learn. Plus it's so easy to write code these days I can do the bulk of that too. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with . . . breaking into the embedded space! The other day I met a guy at the GDG Phoenix Meetup (that I still run!) and he told me about his job where he and another guy do the tech work at a company making over 6 million in revenue with just those two tech people and they make a real IoT product that's manufactured in China and sold on Amazon. Between them they have an Android and iOS app, they have a firmware that they write to a an esp32, they do PCB design, they design and 3D print prototypes of the devices and then send that out to get manufactured.
- 💬 Ask me about 3D printing! Or AIoT! Or event organizing! Or engineering management! Or AoE 2! Or raising kids to love the Nintendo Switch and all things Mario! Or Ebikes! Or home improvement! I can't pick just one!
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm still on twitter, yes, twitter, but on a few other social networks as @tooshel (Blue Sky, Discord, Telegram, etc). Email me at sheldon@tooshel.com. And my phone number is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tooshel/)! 
- ⚡ Fun fact: My nick name (tooshel) started in college where I was a fan of Too $hort and "The Ghetto" and wore a home made Too $hort hat. It wasn't long before my friends started to call me "TooShel" even after I wasn't as much of a fan anymore and moved on to 2Pac, Ice Cube, and Nirvana . . . and lately, Lamar and Taylor Swift thanks to my daughter.
