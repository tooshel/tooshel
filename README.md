### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ It's a new year! 2024-01-02! Here is what I'm up to!

The defaults here are fantastic so I'm just going to expand on each of them no matter how unconfortable. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Satellite.im as an Engineering Manager.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Klipper and this whole Voron echosystem. I have a mostly build Voron 0.2 sitting on my workbench for weekend free time! I have been at it for a few months though I haven't spent many weekends on it lately. This section is a reminder that I should add a date here and keep this updated often!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some SasS product! I've been working in the industry for many years and now I'm usually the oldest person in the room. I appreciate the oportunites and love that I have something to offer but will that be true when I'm 60 or 70? More and more the day to day of software seems like a young person's game! So I want to get more into product development, marketing, etc and fill in more of the parts of running a company that I need.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with . . . well, the above! I love my job now but what's next?
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about 3D printing! Or AIoT! Or event organizing! Or engineering management! Or AoE 2! Or raising kids to love the Nintendo Switch and all things Mario! Or Ebikes! Or home improvement! I can't pick just one!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm still on twitter, yes, twitter, but on a few other social networks as @tooshel. Email me at sheldon@tooshel.com. And my phone number is probably on [linkedin]((https://www.linkedin.com/in/tooshel/)https://www.linkedin.com/in/tooshel/)! 
- âš¡ Fun fact: My nick name (tooshel) started in college where I was a fan of Too $hort and "The Ghetto" and wore a home made Too $hort hat. It wasn't long before my friends called me Too Shel even after I wasn't as much of a fan anymore and moved on to 2Pac, Ice Cube, and Nirvana. 90s music is awesome! The only thing that could have made it better is if TSwift was making music back then.
